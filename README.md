+ Tested multiple models and NLP techniques to compare classification accuracy of tweets with ‘covid19’ hashtag
+ Models included Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, BERT
+ Utilized NLP techniques such as Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency, Stemming, and Lemmatization
+ Combinations of models and techniques compared using accuracies generated from 10-fold cross validation
+ Support Vector Machine using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency was the best ‘traditional’ model and yielded an 80% percent accuracy on training data and 79% accuracy on testing data
+ BERT trained on the tweets boasted an 85% accuracy on testing data after minimal  hyperparameter tuning
